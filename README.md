Hi, I'm Daniel Favour Oshidero, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my GitHub profile.

I'm a versatile professional with a strong background in design. My journey began in the field of architecture, where I honed my skills in both creative and technical aspects of design through my Bachelors degree. I am currently pursuing my Masters degree in Computer Science.

Currently, I'm on an exciting learning journey, delving into the world of programming with a current focus on C and C++. Additionally, I'm actively working on various projects using JavaScript, exploring the endless possibilities it offers.
